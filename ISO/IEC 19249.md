# ISO/IEC 19249:2017  
**Information technology — Security techniques — Catalogue of architectural and design principles for secure products, systems and applications**

This international standard defines a set of principles to guide the secure design and architecture of systems. It is divided into **five architectural principles** and **five design principles**.

## Five Architectural Principles

1. **Domain Separation**  
   Every set of related components (applications, data, resources) is grouped into a single entity called a domain with a common set of security attributes.  
   - Example: x86 privilege rings — kernel in ring 0, user applications in ring 3.  
   - Related to the Goguen-Meseguer Model.

2. **Layering**  
   Structuring a system into abstract layers allows security policies to be enforced and validated at each level.  
   - Example: OSI 7-layer model in networking.  
   - Example: High-level programming languages hiding low-level disk system calls.  
   - Closely related to **Defence in Depth**.

3. **Encapsulation**  
   Hide internal implementation details and expose only controlled interfaces (methods/APIs).  
   - Example (OOP): A `Clock` object provides `increment()` instead of direct access to the `seconds` variable.  
   - Example (systems): Using a well-defined API to interact with a database instead of direct SQL access.

4. **Redundancy**  
   Ensures **availability** and **integrity** by duplicating critical components.  
   - Example: Server with dual power supplies.  
   - Example: RAID 5 — data remains available and integrity is protected via parity even if one disk fails.

5. **Virtualization**  
   Sharing physical hardware among multiple isolated operating systems or environments.  
   - Provides strong sandboxing, secure detonation chambers, and better observation of malicious code.  
   - Widely used in cloud environments.

## Five Design Principles

1. **Least Privilege**  
   Also known as “need-to-know” or “need-to-do” basis.  
   Grant only the minimum permissions required to perform a task.  
   - Example: Give a user read-only access to a document if they do not need to modify it.

2. **Attack Surface Minimisation**  
   Reduce the number of entry points and features an attacker can target.  
   - Example: Disable unnecessary services when hardening a Linux server.

3. **Centralized Parameter Validation**  
   All input validation should be performed in a single, reusable component/library to prevent vulnerabilities such as DoS or remote code execution caused by malformed input.

4. **Centralized General Security Services**  
   Security functions (authentication, logging, crypto, etc.) should be provided by centralized, well-tested components.  
   - Example: A dedicated authentication server (with proper HA measures to avoid single points of failure).

5. **Preparing for Error and Exception Handling**  
   Systems must anticipate failures and handle them securely (“fail-safe”).  
   - Example: A crashed firewall should block all traffic instead of allowing everything.  
   - Error messages must not leak sensitive information (e.g., memory dumps containing other users’ data).  
   - Graceful handling of out-of-stock items, database overloads, etc.

These principles from ISO/IEC 19249 provide a globally recognized foundation for building secure products, systems, and applications.
