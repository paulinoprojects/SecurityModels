# ISO/IEC 19249:2017 – Information technology — Security techniques — Catalogue of architectural and design principles for secure products, systems and applications

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published **ISO/IEC 19249:2017**, which provides a catalogue of proven architectural and design principles for building secure products, systems, and applications. The standard defines **five architectural principles** and **five design principles** that are widely recognized as foundational for security engineering.

## Five Architectural Principles

1. **Domain Separation**  
   Every set of related components (applications, data, resources, etc.) is grouped into a single entity called a domain, and each domain is assigned its own security attributes.  
   - Example: x86 processor privilege rings — kernel in ring 0 (highest privilege), user applications in ring 3 (lowest privilege).  
   - Related model: Goguen-Meseguer non-interference model.

2. **Layering**  
   Structuring a system into multiple abstraction layers allows security policies to be enforced at each layer and simplifies validation.  
   - Classic example: OSI 7-layer model in networking.  
   - Programming example: High-level language disk I/O functions hide low-level system calls.  
   - Strongly related to the concept of **Defence in Depth**.

3. **Encapsulation**  
   Hide internal implementation details and expose functionality only through well-defined interfaces.  
   - OOP example: A `Clock` object provides `increment()` instead of direct access to the `seconds` variable.  
   - System-level example: Using a controlled API to interact with a database instead of direct SQL access.

4. **Redundancy**  
   Duplicate critical components or functions to ensure availability and integrity even when failures occur.  
   - Hardware: Servers with dual power supplies.  
   - Storage: RAID 5 (data remains available and integrity is protected via parity if one disk fails).

5. **Virtualization**  
   Sharing physical hardware among multiple isolated environments.  
   - Provides strong sandboxing, secure isolation, safe detonation chambers for malware analysis, and clearer security boundaries.  
   - Widely used in cloud environments.

## Five Design Principles

1. **Least Privilege**  
   Also known as “need-to-know” or “need-to-do” principle.  
   Grant only the minimum permissions required to perform a task.  
   - Example: A user who only needs to read a file gets read-only permission, not write or execute.

2. **Attack Surface Minimisation**  
   Reduce the number of entry points and features that could be exploited.  
   - Common practice: Disable unnecessary services, ports, and software components (e.g., during Linux hardening).

3. **Centralized Parameter Validation**  
   Because invalid or malicious input is a primary attack vector, all input validation should be performed in a single, reusable, and well-tested component/library.  
   - Prevents scattered, inconsistent, or forgotten checks that lead to vulnerabilities (DoS, RCE, etc.).

4. **Centralized General Security Services**  
   Security-critical functions (authentication, authorization, logging, cryptography, etc.) should be provided by dedicated, centralized components.  
   - Example: A single authentication/identity server for the entire system (with appropriate high-availability measures to avoid single points of failure).

5. **Preparing for Error and Exception Handling**  
   Systems must anticipate that errors and exceptions will occur and be designed to **fail securely**.  
   - Fail-safe defaults: A crashed firewall blocks all traffic instead of allowing everything.  
   - Avoid information leakage in error messages (no memory dumps, stack traces exposing sensitive data, etc.).  
   - Graceful handling of exceptional conditions (out-of-stock items, overloaded database, etc.).

These ten principles from ISO/IEC 19249:2017 form a solid international baseline for designing and evaluating the security architecture of any product, system, or application.
